So you're reading the README. That probably means you're wondering why I created this mod. Well...

I don't believe it's fair to have gameplay-altering items which can only be equipped by certain users. With the way that Enigmatic Legacy handles The Architect's Favor, it is literally impossible to use under normal circumstances unless you are a "devoted believer". In other words, the developer gets to decide. This provides an unfair advantage for some users, and the users which are allowed to get it are arbitrarily determined by Aizistral direcrly.

There is an argument to be made, that modpacks can just disable the item from being obtained, and this is true. However, it feels like it's purposefully made obscure so that modpack developers don't see it:

- It's hidden from both the creative menu and JEI, which is typically primarily only done for items unobtainable in survival (and not even The One Box, a creative-only item obviously meant for debugging purposes, is hidden from the creative menu)
- Its recipe is *also* hidden from JEI, only mentioned in the guidebook (not to mention, I couldn't find a way to unlock this guidebook entry without using the /advancement cheat)
- The tooltip is obfuscated if you aren't allowed to equip it, hiding the fact that it has incredibly powerful effects.
- The config option to disable this item refers to it with its *internal* name, that being the Cosmic Scroll, and as I mentioned, the entire tooltip is obfuscated for most players, **including its resource location when you have advanced tooltips on**. The cursed items do this as well, however those tooltips are *not* obfuscated in creative mode, unlike this one.
- The recipe cannot be removed using methods that aren't the config, due to the way the hidden recipes work (unless I missed something).

This item simply rubs me the wrong way in several ways, and I made this mod to try and get my point across.
